## Description:

Fitness Tracker is a fitness/workout app that lets users input the names of exercises they'd like to do and measure their performance.

Whenever a user submits an exercise's name, their app will submit the exercise along with its parameters to the nosql mongoose database.

Each workout in the database also informs the data on the display of the workout dashboard.
